# Binary Tree Implementation in Java

This repository contains a simple implementation of a binary tree in Java. The binary tree supports various operations, including calculating the degree, height, and different types of tree traversals.

## Features

### Binary Tree Methods
- **getDegree()**: Returns the degree of the binary tree (the number of children of a node).
- **getHeight()**: Calculates the height of the binary tree.
- **inOrderTraversal()**: Performs an in-order traversal of the binary tree.
- **preOrderTraversal()**: Performs a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
- **postOrderTraversal()**: Performs a post-order traversal of the binary tree.

### Node Class Methods
The `Node` class represents each individual node of the binary tree. Some common methods include:
- **isRoot()**: Checks if the node is the root of the tree.
- **isLeaf()**: Checks if the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no children).
- **getDegree()**: Returns the degree of the node (the number of children).
- **getLevel()**: Returns the level of the node in the tree.
- **getHeight()**: Calculates the height of the node (the longest path from the node to a leaf).

These methods are essential for building and manipulating the binary tree structure.
